I don't want to be a hero. Being hero in I.T. means that you're working weekends and holidays. One of the reasons that I work in higher-ed is the excellent work-life balance that it provides.
That said, it's still easy to burn out and work longer hours because you're trying to help the professors who teach students and do research that will improve our lives and possibly save the world.

Your own passion can be your best asset and your worst enemy. Your passion makes you strive to be better, and it pummels you from within when you can never seem to do enough.

Thankfully, I've learned how to deal with mild or medium burnout and have been able to slow down and recover. I think that dealing with burnout is a necessary skill that all I.T. people need, because the will deal with at least once during their lifetime.

I've been obsessed with DevOps and I.T. effectiveness because we desperately need to be more effective, and we need to be more humane. Gene Kim's words about making I.T. more humane hit home and gave words to a feeling that I had.

I see an especially trying time ahead. The landscape is changing drastically, and things will get better, but it will take staggering amounts of work to accomplish the tasks that will make things better.

At work, I'm currently wrestling with these things. I'm rewriting our account provisioning backend to make it more maintainable. I've added code comments to each method and added unit tests. Another huge project is migrating from RHEL5 with CFengine to RHEL7 with Puppet. I believe that things will better once we're finished because we can leverage lots of code that others have already written.

Ironically, my passion and skills puts me in the defacto hero position and people expect my to be the hero, because I can do it. 'Saving the day' is a great feeling, but I try to discourage people from expecting me to be the hero.
